# Contributing to Attractor

## Philosophy

This project follows the [Software Factory](https://factory.strongdm.ai/) philosophy pioneered by StrongDM: **no humans write, read, or verify the actual code in this repository.** All code is authored, reviewed, and refined exclusively by AI agents.

This is a deliberate choice, not a shortcut. The core principle is that human involvement in the code itself introduces the very biases, shortcuts, and blind spots that agents are free from. Humans set direction, define goals, describe desired behaviour, and evaluate outcomes — but the code is the agent's domain entirely.

If you're considering contributing, please read [factory.strongdm.ai](https://factory.strongdm.ai/) first.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open an issue using the **Bug report** template. Include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Java version, OS, and how you're running the app
- The `.dot` source and any relevant log output (`ATTRACTOR_DEBUG=1` for verbose logs)

### Suggesting Features

Open an issue using the **Feature request** template. Describe the problem you're trying to solve, not just the solution.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes. Keep each PR focused — one thing per PR.
3. Run the full check suite before pushing:
   ```bash
   make check
   ```
4. Open a pull request against `main`. Fill out the PR template.

## Code Style

- Kotlin conventions follow the [official Kotlin coding style guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Prefer immutability (`val` over `var`).
- No secrets, API keys, or `.env` files in commits — ever.

---

## Testing

```bash
make test     # run the test suite
make check    # run tests + static checks
```

Add tests for any new behaviour. Existing tests must pass.
